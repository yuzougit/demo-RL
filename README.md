## Project Structure

**train.py** Main loop between Environment and Agent.   
**train_utils.py** Helper functions such as noise function.    
**agent.py** Define how the agent collects experiences, makes actions given observations and updates the action policy.      
**networks.py** Define actor and critic networks   
**prioritized_buffers** Implementation of PER   

**satellite_engine** Simplified satellite simulation   
**satellite_constant** Constants for calculating satellite simulation
